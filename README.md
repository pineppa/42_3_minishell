# 42_3_minishell

## As beautiful as a minishell

The objective of this project is for you to create a simple shell. Yes, your own little bash or zsh. You will learn a lot about processes and file descriptors.

# How to use it

Using `make` will create the minishell executable. It requires the installation of readline. Simply run it with : `./minishell`

# Your shell should:

* Show a prompt when waiting for a new command;
* Search and launch the right executable (based on the PATH variable or by using
relative or absolute path) like in bash;
* It must implement the builtins like in bash:
    * `echo` with option `-n`;
    * `cd` with only a relative or absolute path;
    * `pwd` without any options;
    * `export` without any options;
    * `unset` without any options;
    * `env` without any options and any arguments;
    * `exit` without any options;
* `;` in the command should separate commands like in bash
* `â€™` and ` should work like in bash except for multiline commands
* Redirections `<` `>` `>>` should work like in bash except for file descriptor aggregation;
* Pipes `|` should work like in bash;
* Environment variables ($ followed by characters) should work like in bash;
* `$?` should work like in bash;
* `ctrl-C`, `ctrl-D` and `ctrl-\` should have the same result as in bash;
